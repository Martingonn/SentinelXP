* Packet inspection
* Monitoring port connections for anyone trying to hack you, will allow for whitelisting/blacklisting IPs, even on own network
* Opening .exe and inspecting contents - checks for suspicious code inside .exe files, like obfuscation
* Anti-phishing website module - prevents user from connecting to malicious site by terminating that connection
* MITM detector - does not allow user to browse until they get rid of MITM
* GUI version (maybe)
* Sneaky download prevention - websites will not download anything without your knowledge!
* Cookie and tracker blocker
* Fingerprinting prevention
* Hash comparer - checks for malware from malware database, will also use fuzzy hashes
* Hash maker - if you find new malware, you will be able to get its hash and send the hash to me so that it will be detected in the future
* Fortifier module - turns off selected unsafe features. Will include:
  * RDP port
  * USB autorun
  * XP File Sharing Services
* The antivirus will remove the "No antivirus" pop-up
* Metadata wiper - will wipe from .txt and image files, will add more later on
* Rootkit scanner - will check for rootkits
* Vigilant Mode - you have to accept Windows processes manually
* .cfg files that saves user preferences
* Light Mode and Dark Mode for GUI (maybe, depends on GUI)
* Directory Protector - protects specified directories (or entire disk) from being accessed/modified by any process except this one
* Proxy - routes traffic through another OS, preferably a new one. The proxy will detect any malicious traffic that you might exhibit.
* "Unknown Publisher" warning will be tweaked
* Potentially Unwanted Program and Bloatware detection (also via hashes and fuzzy hashes)
* Intrusive Cookie Clearance
* Temp file clearance
* Storage tips (unused programs, temp files etc. that can be deleted)
* Behaviour blocker - blocks common malware behaviours like opening ports

///Done\\\
* Menu module to operate on other modules - the first thing made on this project, will show Security Tip of the Day
* File Monitor - shows files being modified, accessed and created, alerts if that happens in system
* Windows Integrity Check - checks for missing/corrupted .dlls

///Expansion ideas\\\
* Menu module will show Security Tip of the Day
* Menu will have presets that each run specified modules (each specified by user)
* File monitor will show and block malicious processes (will require custom kernel module)
* Windows Integrity Check will now check for more applications missing
