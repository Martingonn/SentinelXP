* Packet inspection
* Monitoring port connections for anyone trying to hack you, will allow for whitelisting/blacklisting IPs, even on own network
* Opening .exe and inspecting contents - checks for suspicious code inside .exe files, like obfuscation
* Anti-phishing website module - prevents user from connecting to malicious site by terminating that connection
* MITM detector - does not allow user to browse until they get rid of MITM
* GUI version (maybe)
* Sneaky/side download prevention - websites will not download anything without your knowledge!
* Cookie and tracker blocker
* Fingerprinting prevention
* Hash comparer - checks for malware from malware database, will also use fuzzy hashes
* Hash maker - if you find new malware, you will be able to get its hash and send the hash to me so that it will be detected in the future
* Fortifier module - turns off selected unsafe features. Will include:
  * RDP port
  * USB autorun
  * XP File Sharing Services
* Rootkit scanner - will check for rootkits
* Vigilant Mode - you have to accept Windows processes manually
* .cfg files that saves user preferences FOR EVERY SCRIPT
* Light Mode and Dark Mode for GUI (maybe, depends on GUI)
* Proxy - routes traffic through another OS, preferably a new one. The proxy will detect any malicious traffic that you might exhibit.
* "Unknown Publisher" warning will be tweaked
* Potentially Unwanted Program and Bloatware detection (also via hashes and fuzzy hashes)
* Intrusive Cookie Clearance
* Temp file clearance (maybe)
* Behaviour blocker - blocks common malware behaviours like opening ports
* Installer - will have "no antivirus" popup removal and GUID generation built-in
* Instruction manual - will be a .pdf outlining file structure and different quirks of the modules
* Directory Protector - protects specified directories (or entire disk) from being accessed/modified by any process except this one (will require custom kernel module)

///Done\\\
* Menu module to operate on other modules - the first thing made on this project, will show Security Tip of the Day
* File Monitor - shows files being modified, accessed and created, alerts if that happens in system
* Windows Integrity Check - checks for missing/corrupted .dlls
* "No antivirus" pop-up remover script (no support for GUID yet)
* RAM checker - shows RAM used by Windows and non-Windows processes
* Metadata wiper - wipes metadata from .jpg and .txt files

///Expansion ideas\\\
* The antivirus will remove the "No antivirus" pop-up only if it has unique GUID for user, therefore a GUID generator will be needed
* Menu module will show Security Tip of the Day
* Menu will have presets that each run specified modules (each specified by user)
* File monitor will show and block malicious processes (will require custom kernel module)
* Windows Integrity Check will play success.wav when no files are missing (code is there, .wav is not)
* Windows Integrity Check will automatically get syslist.txt and put it into "settings" folder when none is present
* Windows Integrity Check will diagnose if a specific system file missing is related to a known type of worm
* Make Metadata Wiper clean more files of metadata

//Bugs\\
* Fix A00001 error for Storage Check
* Fix A00002 error for Metadata Wiper

///Finished expansion ideas\\\
* Windows Integrity Check checks for A LOT MORE system files missing. Moreover, you can create a list of files to check for yourself.
* Windows Integrity Check allows for presets. For example, if you modified your XP using nLite, you will be able to skip the warnings for components that you removed.
