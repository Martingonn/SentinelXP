# SentinelXP
An antivirus for Windows XP. Free, forever, no spyware, no bloatware.
# What is it?
There will be a few scripts combined by an interface.
# Original Author 
Development was started on April 13th, 2025, by Marcin Jacek Chmiel.
# Contributors 
As of now, there are no more contributors than the original author.
If you have any problems or suggestions, contact me: *martingonn-dev@outlook.com*
 # How can you contribute?
 Simply make a contribution here, on Github. Another, better way, would be to send me links to malware repositories so that I can train the antivirus.
 <br> Remember, you have to send me the links/files yourself, as I have no server to send the files to. When I will have, I will only send out file hashes. You will be able to see that, as the project will be open-source forever.
