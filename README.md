 # How can you contribute?
 Simply make a contribution here, on Github. Another, better way, would be to send me links to malware repositories so that I can train the antivirus.
 <br> Remember, you have to send me the links/files yourself, as I have no server to send the files to. When I will have, I will only send out file hashes. You will be able to see that, as the project will be open-source forever.
